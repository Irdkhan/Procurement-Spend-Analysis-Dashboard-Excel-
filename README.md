# Procurement Spend Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

This project demonstrates hands-on Excel skills for procurement analytics, inspired by real-world tasks in a Procurement Internship (e.g., spend tracking, supplier evaluation, cost insights).

## Project Overview
Created an interactive Excel dashboard using sample purchase order data to:
- Categorize and summarize total spend by supplier, item category, and location
- Track basic supplier performance (delivery delays, on-time percentage, cost differences)
- Visualize key metrics and highlight areas for potential cost savings or process improvements

The dashboard helps simulate daily procurement activities like analyzing spend trends, checking supplier reliability, and preparing simple reports.

## What the Dashboard Shows
- Total spend breakdown by supplier and category (e.g., highest spend areas)
- Average order delay and on-time delivery percentage per supplier
- Cost variance (difference between baseline and actual prices)
- Monthly spend trends and delayed order list
- Simple charts and filters (using slicers) to explore the data interactively

## Key Features & Excel Tools Used
- **Data cleaning** and calculated columns (e.g., delay days, on-time flag, cost variance)
- **PivotTables** for spend summaries, performance averages, and monthly trends
- **Charts** (bar, line, pie) for visual insights
- **Slicers** for filtering by supplier, category, or month
- **Conditional formatting** to highlight high delays or cost differences
- **KPI cards** and text boxes for quick summary numbers and recommendations

## How to Use
1. Download the file: `Procurement Analytics Dashboard.xlsx`
2. Open in Microsoft Excel (desktop version recommended for full interactivity)
3. Go to the **Dashboard** sheet
4. Use the slicers (dropdown filters) on the left/top to explore different suppliers or time periods
5. Check the Pivot sheet for detailed tables if needed

## Dataset
- Simulated procurement data (~50 purchase orders)
- Columns include: PO Number, Supplier Name, Category, Item Description, Total Cost, Order Date, Delivery Dates, Quality Status, etc.
- Sources: Adapted from public Kaggle-style procurement datasets

## Relevance to Procurement Roles
This project covers core skills from procurement intern descriptions:
- Spend analytics & categorization
- Supplier performance tracking
- Identifying cost differences and delay issues
- Preparing visual reports for stakeholders
- Using Excel for data organization and insights

## Repository Contents
- `Procurement Analytics Dashboard.xlsx` → Main workbook with all sheets (Input Data, Computation, Pivot, Dashboard)# Procurement Spend Analysis Dashboard

This project builds a simple interactive Excel dashboard using sample procurement data. It analyzes purchase orders to categorize spend, evaluate supplier performance, and highlight basic cost and delivery insights — aligned with typical procurement intern tasks like spend analytics and reporting.

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Spend categorization and aggregation by supplier, item category, and location
- Basic supplier performance tracking (order delays, on-time delivery percentage)
- Cost variance calculation (difference between baseline and actual prices)
- Interactive reporting with PivotTables, charts, and slicers
- Simple data preparation and visualization for stakeholder insights

## Setup

- Download the file: `Procurement Analytics Dashboard.xlsx`
- Open in Microsoft Excel (desktop version recommended for slicers and full interactivity)
- Go to the **Dashboard** sheet to explore
- Use slicers (filters) on the left/top to change views by supplier, category, or time period

## Dataset

- Simulated procurement data (~50 purchase orders)
- Includes columns: PO Number, Supplier Name, Category, Item Description, Total Cost, Order Date, Expected/Actual Delivery Date, Quality Status, Currency, etc.
- Adapted from public procurement-style datasets (e.g., Kaggle-inspired synthetic data)
- Multi-currency and multi-location orders for realistic analysis

## How to Explore

1. Open the Excel file
2. View **Input Data** sheet for raw records
3. Check **Computation** sheet for calculated metrics (delays, on-time flags, cost variance)
4. Explore **Pivot** sheet for summarized tables
5. Interact on **Dashboard** sheet — filter, view charts, and read quick summary insights

This dashboard supports common procurement activities such as tracking spend trends, spotting delayed suppliers, and identifying potential cost differences.
